# Governance

## Overview
This document outlines the governance structure and processes for our project. It defines the roles, responsibilities, and decision-making procedures to ensure effective collaboration and project success. Our goal is to create a transparent and inclusive environment where all contributors can participate and have their voices heard.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Project Lead**: Oversees the overall direction of the project and makes final decisions. Responsible for maintaining the project's vision and ensuring alignment with goals.
- **Core Contributors**: Actively contribute to the project and participate in decision-making. They have write access to the repository and are responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests.
- **Community Contributors**: Provide contributions through pull requests and feedback. They do not have write access but can suggest changes and report issues.

## Decision Making Process
Decisions are made through a consensus-seeking process. If consensus cannot be reached, the Project Lead has the final say. Major decisions require a proposal and a review period of at least one week. During the review period, all core contributors are encouraged to provide feedback and discuss the proposal.

## Communication
- **Mailing List**: Primary communication channel for announcements and discussions. All major updates and decisions are communicated through the mailing list to ensure transparency.
- **Weekly Meetings**: Held every Monday to discuss progress and blockers. Meeting notes are documented and shared with the community.
- **Issue Tracker**: Used for tracking bugs, features, and tasks. Contributors are encouraged to use the issue tracker to report problems and suggest enhancements.

## Amendments
Amendments to this governance document can be proposed by any core contributor. Proposed amendments require a review period of at least two weeks and must be approved by the Project Lead. The amendment process ensures that changes to the governance structure are carefully considered and agreed upon by the community.
